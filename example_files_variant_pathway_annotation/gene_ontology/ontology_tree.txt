To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

def: "An intracellular protein kinase cascade containing at least a MAPK, a MAPKK and a MAP3K. The cascade can also contain an additional tiers: the upstream MAP4K.

comment: MAPK cascades lie downstream of many cell surface receptors and cooperate in transmitting various extracellular signals to the nucleus. One way by which the specificity of each cascade is regulated is through the existence of several distinct components in each tier of the different cascades. The cascades are typically named according to the component in the MAPK tier.

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: Note that although the many U12-type introns have the sequence AT-AC at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U2-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron.

def: "The process whose specific outcome is the progression of a fruiting body organ over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The fruiting body is a spore bearing structure. In fungi, the sporocarp (also known as fruiting body) is a multicellular structure on which spore-producing structures, such as basidia or asci, are borne. The fruiting body is part of the sexual phase of a fungal life cycle, with the rest of the life cycle being characterized by vegetative mycelial growth. The sporocarp of a basidiomycete is known as a basidiocarp, while the fruiting body of an ascomycete is known as an ascocarp. A significant range of different shapes and morphologies is found in both basidiocarps and ascocarps; these features play an important role in the identification and taxonomy of fungi."

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. When annotating eukaryotic species, mitotic or meiotic cytokinesis should always be specified for manual annotation and for prokaryotic species use 'FtsZ-dependent cytokinesis ; GO:0043093' or Cdv-dependent cytokinesis ; GO:0061639.  Also, note that cytokinesis does not necessarily result in physical separation and detachment of the two daughter cells from each other.

comment: The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription.

def: "Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a specific upstream regulatory DNA sequence (transcription factor recognition sequence or binding site) located in the proximal promoter. The proximal promoter is in cis with and relatively close to the core promoter." [GOC:pg, GOC:txnOH]
comment: The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

def: "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus by the chemical structure of the anion portion of a dissociated acid (rather than the acid acting as a proton donor). The acid chemical may be in gaseous, liquid or solid form." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:rn, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid]
comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if an organism were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the organism is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC. If annotating experiments where an acid is playing a role as a proton donor, please annotate to GO:0010447 'response to acidic pH' instead.

comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term. Direct annotations to GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' may be amended during annotation QC.

comment: The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a central event in the signaling phase of the apoptotic process, and it is often used by researchers to monitor this type of cell death. Any event that induces apoptosis will at some point induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Therefore, this term should only be used to annotate gene products that are directly involved in this process. An example is Drp1 (DNM1L, UniProt symbol O00429) in PMID:20850011.

comment: Note that either or both mechanisms mentioned in the definition may be used in this process. Note that both granule release and the engagement of death receptors on target cells result in the induction of apoptosis in the target cell. Note that both CD4 and CD8 positive T cells can mediate apoptosis of target cells, independently of their definition as 'helper' T cells or not.

[PMID:12837608, PMID:15890982]
comment: Note that podosomes can be distinguished from other F-actin-rich structures or from other matrix contacts. For example, focal adhesions and focal contacts do not display a core structure of F-actin. Unlike focal adhesions, podosome assembly does not require de novo protein synthesis. However, most of the podosome ring components are found in focal adhesions and other cell-matrix contacts. Podosomes are typically found in cells that cross tissue boundaries, recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells, and are often sites of extracellular matrix degradation.

comment: In E. coli, the first step of the reaction is reductive elimination of sulfur from L-cysteine by IscS cysteine desulfurase to form an enzyme-bound cysteine-persulfide intermediate.

Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune response found in Mus musculus." [GOC:add, GOC:mtg_sensu, ISBN:0781735149, ISBN:1405196831]

comment: This term was made obsolete because it describes involvement of the nodal signaling pathway in lateral mesoderm left/right asymmetry. Nodal proteins are members of the TGF-beta superfamily, but are distinct from TGF-beta proteins themselves. TGF-beta proteins are not currently known to regulate left/right asymmetry in the lateral mesoderm.

The pathway ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription." [GOC:ascb_2009, GOC:signaling, PMID:22001186, Reactome:REACT_18416.2]
comment: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) can act both as an extracellular ligand for cell surface G-protein coupled receptors, and as an intracellular second messenger. GO:0003376 describes a pathway where S1P acts as an extracellular ligand. Where S1P acts within the cell to transmit a signal, consider instead 'intracellular signal transduction ; GO:0035556' or 'G-protein signaling, coupled to S1P second messenger (sphingosine kinase activating) ; GO:0001789'.

def: "A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense denotes an action, or activity, that a gene product (or a complex) performs. These actions are described from two distinct but related perspectives: (1) biochemical activity, and (2) role as a component in a larger system/process." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code "no data" (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

comment: This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.

comment: This term was obsoleted because "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription vs "specific" transcription were determined not to be separable, distinct process. Thus, terms trying to distinguish "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription from "specific" transcription were removed from both the Molecular Function and the Biological Process ontologies.

A second ATP-dependent class modifies the conformation of chromatin. Another type of coregulator activity is the bridging of a DNA-binding transcription factor to the basal transcription machinery.

def: "OBSOLETE. Catalysis of the reaction: (5-L-glutamyl)-peptide + an amino acid = peptide + 5-L-glutamyl-amino acid." [EC:2.3.2.2]
comment: This term was obsoleted because it does not correspond to a physiological reaction.\nUsage comment: The gene family commonly referred to as gamma-glutamyl transferases (GGT) catalyze hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl bonds in gamma-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione. In a test tube one can set up conditions in which the enzyme will transfer the gamma-glutamyl portion of the substrate to an acceptor molecule, but this requires non-physiologic conditions, including millmolar concentrations of an acceptor such as glygly. This reaction is used in assays to detect the presence of the enzyme, but is not a physiological function of members of the GGT family (PMC4388159), which should be annotated to a suitable hydrolysis term instead (e.g. glutathione hydrolase activity).
